the walls between real-life and networks have long since tumbled. the age of hyper-connectedness is not merely the constant changes and infinite possibilies, but also the massive emotional changes such over-connectedness brings about in people. you need a response, every cell of your body needs to be held. even in your deepest dreams, you continue to inhale information and expand connections. between the technological rapture and social rupture, what does it mean to live as an artist, thinker, or risk-taker today? 
	
we like to think of a space where explorers get to pause once in a while, rock the boat and then be still. a space where we embody the reality for one another in which we see the world whole.
